## Example [#example]

You can get information about the stone in Java Edition 1.20 by accessing the API as follows.

```bash

      "min": 1
    }
  ],

## Endpoints [#endpoints]

We provide information on each version in both the Java Edition and the Bedrock Edition.

<Callout emoji='⚠️'>
  Currently, Bedrock Edition is under development and some directives do not function.
</Callout>

If the last directive of the endpoint is omitted, it will return a list of endpoints that partially match it. For example, if you want to get the list of version endpoints, you can do the following request.

```json filename="GET https://api.minecraft.gammatrees.com/java"
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "name": "1.0",
      "url": "https://api.minecraft.gammatrees.com/java/1.0"
    },
    {
      "name": "1.1",
      "url": "https://api.minecraft.gammatrees.com/java/1.1"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
