  Minecraft API for Web
</h1>

This API allows you to easily retrieve information about Minecraft.

<Callout emoji='✅'>
  This is a <strong>consumption-only</strong> API — only the HTTP GET method is available on
  resources.
</Callout>

This API does not require authentication, and all resources are completely open and available. There are no strict rate limits in place, but we hope that you limit the frequency of requests as sending a large number of requests in a short period of time can have a significant impact on the hosting server and increase costs.
